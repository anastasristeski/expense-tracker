# üí∞ Expense Tracker App (React Native + Firebase)

A  mobile **Expense Tracker** application built with **React Native** and **Expo**. This app provides full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for expenses, securely persisting all data using a **Firebase Realtime Database**.

## üß≠ Navigation Flow & Structure

The app's navigation provides two clear paths for expense viewing and management, primarily built with **React Navigation's** Stack and Bottom Tabs:

### 1. Root Navigation (Stack Navigator)

The main stack handles the two top-level screens:

| Screen Name | Component | Presentation | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`ExpensesOverview`** | (Bottom Tabs) | Hidden Header | The main interface for viewing expenses. |
| **`ManageExpense`** | `ManageExpense` | Modal | Used for adding a new expense or editing an existing one. |

### 2. Bottom Tab Navigator (`ExpensesOverview`)

This component structures the expense viewing screens and includes the primary **Add Expense** button in the header.

| Tab Name | Title | Icon | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`RecentExpenses`** | Recent Expenses | `hourglass` (Ionicons) | Shows only expenses from the past week. |
| **`All Expenses`** | All Expenses | `calendar` (Ionicons) | Shows the complete list of all transactions. |
